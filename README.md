# AngularJS History of World War II (greatly abridged)

## Overview

This is intended to be an demo project interactive World War 2 history site
modeled on "The West Point History of the Civil War" by Rowan Technology.

Specific chapter: Brecourt Manor Assault, following the D-Day landings in 1944.

4th Division map is from Cross-Channel Attack, by Gordon A. Harrison,
Chapter VIII ("The Sixth of June"), page 30

## Prerequisites

## Workings of the application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application.
  An application server is emulated by fetching static json files.


## Development with angular-ww2

The following docs describe how you can test and develop further this application.


### Installing dependencies

The application relies upon various node.js tools, such as Bower, Karma and Protractor.  You can
install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also run bower, which will download the angular files needed for the current step of the
tutorial.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run
it whenever you like.

### Running the app during development

- Run `npm start`
- navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html` to see the app running in your browser.
